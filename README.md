# python_projects
My miscellaneous python projects that aren't large enough for their own repositories.

## nbt
A utility for interacting with the minecraft NBT bytecode format. Implementations for particular NBT objects were started.

## wiki
A project to download and convert an arbitrary wiki site into an offline version by parsing each page for links to more pages within the site. I successfully downloaded the entire Stardew Valley wiki due to its small page number. I stopped working on this project after implementing parallel requests and then accidentally DDOSing my network with 90,000 simultaneous incoming html documents.

## chem
A text-based tool for getting molecular weights of compounds and performing stoichiometry.

## farkle
A strategic probability analysis of the dice-rolling game farkle, done without generating any random numbers.

## graph
This script takes in an image and generates a 3D frequency plot of colors in the form of a minecraft structure file that can be loaded into the game for viewing. I did this using the NBT script described above to process the data into a structure binary.

## knight
Solving the knight's tour puzzle.
